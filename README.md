Webscraper for Land grant university course catalogs.

From the Spring 2020 Discovery Project website:
ESPM - Addressing Structural Inequality in U.S. Agricultural Higher Education: 
An Assessment of Pedagogical Practices and Food Systems Coursework at Land-grant Institutions
In the last decade, many U.S. “land-grant” agricultural universities (including UC Berkeley) 
have turned a reflexive lens on the fact that their institutions marginalize certain community members.
These schools have begun to ask how inequities within their food and agriculture education perpetuate 
food systems injustices in the U.S. more broadly. This research project critically evaluates these 
nascent institutional efforts by examining how agriculture schools use pedagogical practices to improve 
equity and inclusion outcomes. We will build Python code to web scrape online course catalog descriptions 
at all 112 federally-funded agriculture schools to assess their pedagogical methods and types of food 
systems topics taught.

Here are some references I used in the webscraper:
