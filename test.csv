ANSC #444A - Animal Ethics: Your Child or Your Pet ,Credits: 4,"Attributes: Environment,TechSociety(Disc); Inquiry (Discovery); Writing Intensive Course","Human attitudes toward other animals are generally divided into five categories: animal exploitation, animal use, animal welfare, animal rights, and animal liberation. While all five categories are examined, this course concentrates on the differences between animal welfare and animal rights. These two categories differ fundamentally on the basis of the ethical or moral status they give animals. Past human societies have justified both the worship of animals and the torture and sacrifice of animals to the gods. Animal rights believers rely on a rights-based philosophy, while animal welfare advocates concentrate on a utilitarian based set of values. Course concentrates on the application of these two ethical philosophies to current uses of animals such as the use of animals in research, the use of animals as food (factory farming), the production and use of transgenic animals, and the use of animals as organ donors for humans (xenotransplantation). Since animal rights is, in itself, not a discipline, students depend on information from other disciplines ranging from moral philosophy and ethics to history to genetics, production agriculture, and ethology. Writing intensive."
